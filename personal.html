        <p>﻿The computer company Apple has always been lauded for it’s seer like ability to predict the next big thing in consumer tech and then release a killer product, catching the competition with their pants down. It was rumored that if Steve Jobs hadn’t died of pancreatic cancer, he would have steered Apple into the automotive industry. As a consumer, the IoT has just gotten a start in the automobile. Since smart phones have gained massive popularity over the last decade, it seems natural that your mobile phone should interface with your main means of mobility- your car. There is a push to develop mobile apps that interface with the car’s onboard computer. Ford has published an API for interacting with its onboard computer to then control your smart phone - think being able to call a friend, play the next track on your internet radio, or ask for directions. Likewise, BMW has released a proprietary app which hints at IoT-ish functionality as it allows BMW owners with an iPhone or Android device to remotely unlock their car, start the climate control system, locate their car using GPS, and push navigation routes to their car. This is all accomplished over the mobile network and is only available on select models. </p><p>Automobiles connecting to mobile networks is not a new concept. Ford’s API allows programmers to tap into Ford’s OnStar system which Ford has used for years to provide roadside assistance to drivers covered by a mobile network. A European Union act was passed earlier this year stipulating that all new cars must be fitted with a GPS and GSM receiver. This is similar to the OnStar system in that its current purpose is to assist malfunctioning vehicles and definitely not let shady NSA agents track your every step. Privacy concerns aside, the hope is that in the future, IoT-like applications will be able to piggyback these sorts of wireless systems and give automobiles IoT functionality.</p><p>We can see that true IoT-like functionality doesn’t currently exist in the automotive industry. To truly be part of the IoT, we would expect a car to act like an independent node, communicating autonomously with its internet-embedded surroundings such that it could learn from objects like nearby cars, businesses, road surfaces, and people to do more sophisticated things than just switching the song on your Pandora radio. Check out the future section of the website to see what current experimental IoT technologies may be implemented in your next car.</P>

      <div style="display:none"><div id="zigbee-popup">
        <p>﻿Think about the actions you might perform upon entering your home after work: flicking on the lights, becoming partially blinded by the light, dimming the lights, realizing its cold as balls, turning on the heat, realize your neighbors can see you undressing, closing the blinds. Some of these actions might be pretty routine and could be automated to increase both your efficiency and energy efficiency. When you leave your house, heating or A/C should automatically shut off. When you leave a room, lights should dim or shut off. When you load a dishwasher, it might not need turn on until late at night when power is cheapest. The list goes on. It is easy to see where technology has a place to increase the efficiency of our domestic lives. The IoT is coming to the rescue.</p><p>Zigbee represents just one of the emerging 802.15.4 wireless standards whose primary purpose is low power, short range communication- perfect for a network of ordinary domestic objects. Named after the dance that bees do to communicate the whereabouts of flower fields, Zigbee’s goal is to provide communication between a mesh of domestic devices. Zigbee was first designed in the late 90s, however businesses have taken almost ten years to standardize Zigbee protocols and band together to start creating devices which can communicate with different Zigbee devices. There are currently over 100 companies which have agreed to produce their proprietary wireless products using this common protocol, which is good because before any networking technology can gain footing, it needs a critical mass of producers and users. </p><p>There are already many devices that have been fitted with Zigbee communicators. Their website lists things like wireless light bulbs, sockets, switches, dimmers, locks, access keys, and motion detectors; all boring domestic widgets. Who really cares? The cool aspect of Zigbee isn’t necessarily the things that it connects, but how they connect and convey useful information. Zigbee devices create a mesh network much like the internet. A communication between two devices might take place between a series of hops on other Zigbee devices. Thus Zigbee devices serve to both send original data and forward data. So, even though two devices have a maximum range of 100m, a network could potentially expand to your entire 9-story mansion. Indeed, this is how one hotel in Las Vegas controls its room environment and entertainment system. Each room is fitted with several Zigbee sensors and controllers. A base station connects this system to the larger internet so that hotel management can have absolute control. However, most of the time this is not needed for the Zigbee network can locally detect when a room has become vacant and do things like close the blinds, shut the lights off, and turn on the Roomba (well, not quite yet).</p>

        <p>Again, Zigbee is not the official local mesh network standard. There are other competitors such as Zwave. We will probably see something similar to HDDVD and BluRay or Betamax and VHS occur where one new consumer technology eventually wins out. We will benefit as consumers from this decision because it will lead to more connected devices in our homes, working together to make smart decisions on how to best cater to us and save the planet’s resources</p>

        <p>﻿Devices like Jawbone’s UP or the fitbit are two bracelet computers which track information about the user’s nutrition, sleeping patterns, and activity. This data is stored in proprietary databases which the respective companies process and make accessible via webapps and smartphone apps. This data is nice to have, however it doesn’t fall under the criteria of IoT quite yet. To be truly on the IoT, each device would be networked, not only sensing data about the wearer, but sharing it data with other devices. <a href="/future.html">Click here to find out about the future of wearable computer technology.</a></p><p>There are test technologies being developed which will probably find homes in a myriad array of devices which will be connected to the IoT. This past September, Intel announced the ‘Quark’ processor. It is ultra-low power consuming yet powerful enough to run applications which require a full network stack. In their announcement, Intel specifically stated that this technology is ment for small devices connecting to the internet of things. Large corporations are taking the IoT seriously. Improvements in sensor technology is also a requirement for a functioning IoT. MEMS or microelectromechanical systems are composites of tiny sensors and microprocessor. They use non-classical physics techniques to accurately gather and process data like acceleration, gyroscopic information, and can even harvest energy from the environment to power themselves. MEMS is beginning to become mainstream especially in the auto industry where they are used in sensors which deploy airbags and sense tire pressure. MEMS is also used within the Oculus Rift, the virtual reality goggles which is trying to revolutionize gaming. It uses MEMS to predict the motion of a user’s head so that it can display the relevant frames to the user with low latency. </p>

        </div>
        <p>In the next few years we will probably see the cheapening of MEMS and an explosion in cheap wearable devices. Until the price comes down and wearable computing becomes something which is commonplace, the IoT will not find a footing in this field.</p>

      <div style="display:none"><div id="home-popup">
        <p>﻿Currently, it is possible to buy a kit and install some <a href="https://www.meethue.com/en-GB/whatisnew">special light bulbs</a> around your house that you can control from your iphone from anywhere in the world. Pretty neat, but for most people this is practically useless. These sorts of technologies represent the “early adopter” products that will inevitably lead to a more functional, wider adopted product line that won’t so much be an interesting conversation piece, unless you can strike up a rousing chat over your washer and dryer.</p><p>But some can be useful like:<br/>You can unlock your door with your phone, just by walking up to the door. These devices will connect to your home internet wirelessly and will communicate with your personal device such as a phone using bluetooth. When they detect you coming home or are in range of the home will unlock the door for you (by rolling the bolt in the door) so you don’t have to find your keys. This can also make your home safer as the device will also lock the door after you leave so you don’t have to remember to do it. It will add convenience as you don’t have to be home to let someone in; say for example your mother comes to your house and you are not home yet with just your phone you can unlock the door for them. You can also give access to people by adding the name to the account associated with the lock. These will also be able to tell you when someone goes in or out and who it was, so you can find out how has been in your house and for how long they were there. The device is secure because if someone steals your phone you only need access to the internet to display access with that device and assign it to a new one so you can get back into your house. The devices also communicate using secure encrypted signals. But if you are worried it will still work with old fashioned keys.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EFlPncm4fnY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><p>Find some locks</P><a href="http://www.august.com/">August</a><br/><a href="https://lockitron.com/">Lockitron</a>

            The internet of things will mean that your actions and reactions are more connected to the internet than ever before. With the benefits this brings there are also major security and privacy issues introduced. Privacy involves the right to keep your information private and control who has access it to it, poor security will undoubtedly put a users privacy at risk. Many objects within the internet of things track movement of the user or the users daily actions without any obvious signal that the information is being recorded. This means that the user can be creating data about their actions unknowingly. Regardless of source data needs to be kept privately and stored securely, to achieve this a combined effort between the company gathering data and the governments is implemented.</p></div>

            <div class="col-md-6"><p>﻿
             Privacy is also important on a much larger scale, with more and more systems in the public and industrial domain connected to the internet, the security of these needs to be a priority. Consider smart grids, a country's power controlled by computational devices, if hackers could infiltrate these the effects could be severe. The same applies to allowing the automation of many procedures, especially when these are also connected to the internet. On a personal level especially with medical devices security is a concern. Currently people have medical devices within them or linked to them that are also connected to wirelessly to the internet. These devices can often perform actions that could be fatal, for example a pacemaker delivering a shock to a heart in a normal rhythm, or an insulin pump giving a fatal dose. The video opposite shows a famous example of a hacker attacking one of these devices.</p></div>

            <div class="col-md-6"><p>﻿
             There are a number of policies in used to help keep data private especially within the IoT. However these policies need to be enforced so clients privacy can be guaranteed. To tackle privacy issues, self regulation or legislative regulation can be used. Whilst self-regulation is less costly publicly, its effectiveness is questioned as participation is not enforced and companies can use policies to their own advantage. Legislative regulation is costly and hard to enforce, however allows direct dictation of guidelines to be followed. A compromise is a co-legislation approach, where the government outlines a framework for companies to follow and they implement it with there own individual policies and joint enforcement.</p></div>

              Saving energy and increasing efficiency are currently both considered to be of concern for homeowners, electricity and gas are expensive, and environmental factors are a growing concern. The internet of things helps to achieve higher efficiency and better energy use in both of these areas. Smart objects can sense their environment, making autonomous  decisions according to the current state and dictated responses, this accurate decision making ability allows faster reaction to control energy use within the home. Allowing smart objects to make these decisions leads to a greater level of efficiency as a device is always listening to its sensors, when a human may be distracted and a reaction to a change in environment will be delayed.

               These products can also save energy by allowing remote activation of devices. For example lighting and heating, when you leave for work and forget to turn the lights off you can get on to an app and switch them off remotely, saving energy that would otherwise have been wasted. An experimental smart home was created by Orange recently, this introduced a wide variety a technology normally found in commercial environments to the home, and can be purchased on amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inside-Smart-Home-Richard-Harper/dp/1852336889">here</a>. Smart homes combine a wide variety of products to create more interactive way of living, with a range of appliances connected to the internet, some provide extra energy efficiency, but many also offer functions using more electricity than their traditional counterparts, see the <a href="http://www.firebox.com/product/6068/iKettle?aff=1888&gclid=CNvsgozHirsCFa-WtAodQksAiA">ikettle for example</a>.
