        <p>MEMS comprises a wide range of microsensors which are built into an electric circuit, giving it both physical world detection capabilities as well as the ability to preprocess this data before sending it off to the computer system at large. Further, MEMS can also be mechanical devices which can manipulate the world. This can be anything from small gearing systems to channels which disrupt electric frequency output. Every time you get into a car, there are hundreds of MEMS sensors protecting you. They control airbag deployment, sense tire pressure, fuel pressure, car occupancy, and occupant weight. You are probably also familiar with the MEMS sensors inside of your phone which allow it to sense vibration and orientation. MEMS devices are becoming more sophisticated. In biological applications, scientists can grow individual cells in massive arrays of microscopic pools which are irrigated by MEMS devices. It sounds like science fiction, but these technologies will progress and become integrated into all sorts of internet enabled devices.</p>
        <p>The increased use of MEMS in consumer electronics has driven the <a href="http://www.digikey.com/supply-chain-hq/us/en/articles/semiconductors/mems-market-grows-as-prices-decline/1058">price down</a>. This trend will likely continue and people will find novel uses for MEMS with or without the aid of the IoT.</p>

      <div style="display:none"><div id="metcalf-popup">
        <p>Metcalf’s law states that the usefulness of a network is directly related to the number of connected users. Originally used to describe any compatible communicating devices such as telephones and fax machines, the law now refers to the number of internet users. Since the internet is accessible on many more devices and accessible from many more networks than it was ten years ago, Metcalf’s law has never been more timely.</p> 
        <p>Metcalf’s law is highly related to the business concept of network effects. Some businesses benefit from a service only when several other businesses join in. This is true for say, a rental car fleet tracker. If many companies agree to start sharing their vehicles based on a built in vehicle tracking system, the system only becomes useful when a large portion of all the company’s fleets are tracked. In internet terms, a social network like Facebook becomes much more fun when all your friends are using it versus if you and Mark Zuckerberg were the only two users.</p>
        <p>The obvious extension to the IoT is that Metcalf’s law is sometimes very hard to overcome. For instance with networked automobiles, it requires that a good amount of consumers buy cars with networking and M2M (machine to machine) communication protocols built in before the services that this extra hardware provides can overcome the cost associated with buying this extra hardware. On the bright side, since computing and sensing technology is becoming ever cheaper and addressing capabilities with IPv6 are becoming massively more capable, the amount of things connected to the IoT is set to explode. Once this happens and M2M communications are standardized, Metcalf’s law states that the IoT will become as value as the amount of things we hook up to it.</p>

      <div style="display:none"><div id="rfid-popup">
        <p>If everything is to connect to the internet, then the internet will need to distinguish between one thing from another thing. Seems obvious right? We’re all familiar with the concept of IP addresses to uniquely distinguish me at my tablet from you at your laptop, but this is actually a fairly rare case of interaction. On the internet of things, the majority of interactions will be machine to machine. Further, most of these machines may actually be passive entities. Think of all the things which only need to passively exist in the physical world and cyber world; things like a package containing your order from Amazon. Its uniqueness is important because you wouldn’t want to check the tracking info for the package and be told that it’s in Mumbai simply because there are two packages in the world with the same digital identity. And unless you are a control freak, it would be overkill if your package had a built in GPS unit and could tell you exactly where it was when you looked it up on your  smartphone. This realm of identification, having a unique digital address or type identifier, is currently being taken up by RFID, a technology which is key to the future of the IoT.</p>
        <p>RFID, “Radio Frequency Identification”, has been around for a while. In fact, it has its origins in technology developed during World War II. RFID tags are small chips that can broadcast information at a set radio frequency. They can be powered, continuously broadcasting their identification message, or unpowered, requiring a powered device to first charge the tag using a strong electric field. RFID has the advantage over barcodes in that they can be scanned without a clear line of site and they can contain real time data. Various protocols exist for RFID and different countries have different radio frequency bands allocated for use by devices like RFID, which makes the standardization challenging. Recently, the push to standardize and mass produce RFID has fallen on the shoulders of one man, Kevin Ashton. A british technology seer, Ashton claims to be the first human to utter the term, “Internet of Things”. Claims aside, his work has been to create a global standard of RFID in conjunction with researchers at MIT. In his words, the role RFID plays in the IoT is, “...to enable computers to observe, identify and understand the world—without the limitations of human-entered data.” Ashton helped standard the Electronic Product Code, one of the most important protocols for identifying products being transported along a supply chain of say, Tesco or Walmart.</p>
        <p>Currently, several major corporations use RFID in supply chain management, animal tracking, personnel and vehicle tracking, and fun things like checking into and tagging photos from social events. Since mass production of the cheapest, passive RFID tags has driven the price down to less than 5 cents a tag, RFID will continue to find its way into new domains. <a href="" >To learn about an example of how Walmart uses RFID to increase its efficiency, check out our Walmart IoT blurb.</a></p>
        <p>At the current time, it RFID is context specific. That is, you may be able to read an RFID and get all the bits it has to transmit, but if you feed that data to a social media app when the ID is for a FedEx package tracking system, it will probably do you no good because your social media app knows nothing about the how to interpret those bits. As standardization of RFID continues and the IoT becomes larger, we may see a universal protocol for RFID like we have for addressing of computers over the internet. </p>
