          <p>﻿“The first-order impact of sensors is quite obvious — cheap input­output (I/O) for networks and computing devices, plus modest levels of effecting — actual computer-controlled modification of the analog world — and the creation of simple “smartifacts” (defined below). A few examples include:</p><p>Sensor-augmented heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems, delivering dramatic improvements in performance and energy savings</p><p>“Smart” courier boxes with sensors embedded in the cardboard skin that sense accelerations and box treatment en route</p><p>Disposable video cameras as a consumer fad.</p><p>“The second-order impact is more interesting. As effecting becomes richer, look for sensor/effector arrays to mature into simple classes of “smart-stuff” — smart materials and intelligent artifacts — smartifacts. In addition, cheap sensors will contribute greatly to making old notions of hyperautomated manufacturing — cyber-manufacturing — a practical reality. The block in the past has been one of measurement and control granularity: the available sensors and effectors have been too coarse to really deliver the requisite levels of control over the materials. MEMS-scale devices radically reduce the scale of control, and make true automation practical.</p><p>“The possibilities of smartifacts will lead to important third-order consequences, such as the advent of mass-customization. Ever since Stan Davis popularized this concept in the late 1980s, the philosopher’s stone of manufacturing has been finding a means of combining the appeal of unique one-purchaser customization with the economies of scale associated with mass manufacturing. The scale-change triggered by sensors and effectors could set the stage for this to become a reality across a broad segment of industries, from autos to consumer apparel.</p><p>But there are even more interesting third-order impacts. One of the most important will be an acceleration in the decay and centrality of Von Neumann computing architectures. Consider a research initiative already underway to build turbulence-damping “smart-skins” for fighter wings. (7) This work contemplates a leading-edge array of myriad 0.2 millimeter-sized silicon microflaps, interspersed between equally small MEMS turbulence sensors.</p><p>“This array is comparatively buildable today, but computational control is another matter. Even if one had an infinitely fast supercomputer controller in the fuselage linked by fiber-optic network to the array elements, the limits of the speed of light alone would make it impossible for the flaps to respond quickly enough to sensor data sent downwire to the computer and then back out as a control instruction. The only option is to create radically new hyperdistributed computational architectures, in effect a community of processors interspersed throughout the array, where each element is a triad of processor, sensor, and effector. This kind of development opens the information world to a host of way-radical exotica: from theories based on ecology and symbiosis to, in one case, models built around economics.</p><p>“At the fourth-order level, we will witness a generalized substitution of computation for stuff, and possibly the erosion of the entire digital order that we now take for granted. We will literally dematerialize objects, substituting, as Nick Negroponte likes to observe, “electrons for atoms.” Using arrays of sensors and effectors, one could take a structure (say, a bridge truss or aircraft spar) that in inert form lacks the intrinsic structural strength to support a given load, and dynamically sense and align its elements to yield the desired strength at a fraction of the weight of a traditional structure.</p>

        <p>TLDR: Robots comprised of tiny, cell like micro-robots will be the future.</p><p>How does this relate to the IoT exactly? According to this model, robots are comprised of vast arrays of sensors. These sensors are somehow communicating through a network. This network will probably have some of the same characteristics of and evolve from the networks of today.</p>

      <div style="display:none"><div id="car-popup">
        <p>﻿Cars like Google’s driverless car are already driving themselves along with human traffic and making people question the need to issue driver licenses (should a driverless car have to wait in line at the DMV just like their human counterparts? should we allow 4-year-olds to ‘drive’ driverless cars? will my car be considered intoxicated if I fuel it with ethanol? ). Worries aside, this technology will likely be extended towards further automobile automation and IoT integration. Cars may be able to drive their users around, making navigation decisions based on traffic information that they gather from the network of connected cars. Since the cars of the future probably won’t be able to rely on our Earth’s dwindling supply of fossil fuels, they will be recharged at charging ports. Cars will be able to communicate with the power grid and make intelligent decisions about how to charge and when to charge. For instance, power is often cheaper at night because of a lower demand. A car that can tap into a power grid information network could solve the current problem of driving several miles from gas station to gas station, so that you can save a tenth of a cent per gallon. </p><p>Your current car is packed full of safety sensors, gauges, and computer systems (unless you drive a Ford). All these electrical components must be wired with conventional cabling. This cabling adds up to quite a heavy weight - 70 to 80 pounds to be imprecise. Researchers are currently looking at ways to reduce this cabling by making sensors wireless. This would naturally lead to each individual component of a vehicle to be connected to the IoT, giving your car-and the IoT aware world- a clear view into the state of your car. Imagine stepping into your car ten years from now, blissfully lost in a session of World of OculusRiftCraft and mindlessly stepping into your car, vaguely aware that it will get you to work in about 20 minutes. Your car senses that it’s tire pressure is low so it searches the web, looking for the closest service station, drives their on the way to work and has an R2 unit take service your tires before driving you to work. These sorts of things may be possible with an IoT enabled car. </p><p>To make the IoT and automobiles useful, you can’t just have one or two cars connected. One of the major stumbling blocks of the IoT-enabled car (and IoT devices in general) is establishing a common protocol between vehicles. Currently Cisco is leading the way in trying to establish a universal standard, but issues arise when considering the technical complexity and stringent safety requirements of cars. The future probably holds a common Machine-to-machine protocol that will be established so that cars will not only be able to communicate with cars, but any other pertinent device. For instance, there is already a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/transportation/2013/08/traffic_stopping_technologies_waze_smart_traffic_lights_road_trains_and.html">network of cameras installed on streetlights</a> in Toronto. These streetlights communicate over a mobile network, relaying data about traffic congestion. Drivers can access this data with a mobile app and use it to make smart driving choices, reducing their gas consumption. In the IoT future, cars will be able to communicate with a network of traffic sensors, other cars, mobile devices, traffic sensors… virtually every connected and available machine to make smart choices on which tolls to take, which routes are least congested, and probably which drivers are also headed to the same place as you. Hitchhiking might become commonplace. If you prefer to drive in your own car, the IoT could determine which cars are headed towards the same destination as you, forming “trains” of cars which increases efficiency via drafting. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/f5CWf-ztqcM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          As interactive screens become is easier to create and install into everyday environments like the walls in your home or workplace being able to maintain a consistent state between them all so you can continue whatever you are doing will become more complicated. But there are upsides to having both the walls and the floor being interactive. So you have turned up to a building you never been to and are looking for a specific office in the building, then you would be able to ask for directions from the wall and be guide to this office you are looking for using the carpet which will track where you are going. If you think your going to be late for your appointment then you ask the wall to display you schedule and double check when the meeting was at. This can be extended further by you are waiting for the meeting outside the office, so you decide to check the current news then will just ask the wall to display the current news and read it of the wall. By using the wallpaper to check these things instead of your own device means that energy can be saved on your device and make its battery last longer. The wallpaper works by being able to create flexible screens that can be display all the wall up to the edge of the screen, these screens can be combined together to create larger screens. This is possible because OLEDs do not require side lighting so does not need a border. The carpet a strong LED screen below plastic optical fibres that can take the wear of people walking over it..﻿</p>

        <p>Creating circuitry that is flexible on fibres materials such as power is slowly becoming possible and to be printed out of our home inkjet printer. This is done by using a silver nanoparticles doped ink that creates a connection that is flexible enough but remains a continuous connection. A user will be able to download a circuit diagram from the web to complete a task and then just print it off with a normal inkjet print with this special ink. When printed in a certain pattern will create a circuit board that is capable of completing certain task like holding the page number of a book and sending that to your kindle to update the page number there as well.﻿</p>
