        <p>﻿Getting the power to devices is a problem so the first step is to reduce the amount of power a device needs. Usually in smaller devices, communication is a large part of power consumption. Making this communication more power efficient will improve power consumption.</p><p>Short range communication between devices can be done without power but at a slow transfer rate. In some cases not require power to communicate can be important even if the transmission is slow. These devices work by manipulating mobiles, cell towers, wifi or an other radio based transmission media signals (also known as ambient signals) to send signals to another device. To communicate these device either absorb or reflect these radio signals to the other device, this requires no power as the signals already exist. However these device have to communicate slower than normal radio transmission otherwise the signal of the device will be confused with the signals from the ambient signals. Changing to low power transmission media can also improve power usage, changing from bluetooth to bluetooth LE is one such example. Intelligent use of these transmissions can help as well, not transmitting when their is no one there is one example.</p><p>By increasing the amount of power a device can store increases the length between recharging, this is done by increasing power per size of the power supply. Power storage is not developing as quickly as technology as chemist have to find new ways to store energy. Another side of recharging is the time taken to completely recharge traditional chemical batteries are limited by the chemical processes, ultracapacitors charge much faster but don’t store as much power but they may improve in the future </p><p>Easy charging is another aspect of the recharging process. Currently you have to plug your devices in but as the energy transfer rates of induction surfaces and other technologies improve these will properly become more integrated into devices. This will allow the user to simple place their device in a specific place and have it recharge. </p><p>Another solution would be energy harvesting. Energy harvesting can come in several different forms photovoltaic, pesio, thermal and mechanical. Currently photovoltaic is a more robust power supply for these devices, but the other forms like mechanical may become better with time and become a better option or a combination of some of these together. These energy harvesting technologies will either extend the battery life or be able to continuously power the device, this depends on how much draw on power there is compared to the amount being created. </p>
      
      <p>Why is this important? The internet of things requires for many devices to be running and they all nedd power to run.</p>

        <p>﻿Being able to share the information created by the devices that collect data from a user. For interactivity between these devices the data needs to be easily open data. For example a step counter tells you how many steps you complete in a day but does not let you know how many steps in different time frames. But a different step counter may record slightly different data and therefore you cannot compare these devices. With open data you would then be able to compare or integrate the different devices together. This extends from devices to services if you want to multiple services sharing data between the different services is difficult as the services will want different data or the data in different formats. Until data openness is shared between companies and device there won't be a single internet of things. There will be internet of things but for different companies.</p>
