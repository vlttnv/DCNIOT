          <p>﻿Getting the power to devices is a problem so the first step is to reduce the amount of power a device needs. Usually in smaller devices, communication is a large part of power consumption. Making this communication more power efficient will improve power consumption.</p><p>Short range communication between devices can be done without power but at a slow transfer rate. In some cases not require power to communicate can be important even if the transmission is slow. These devices work by manipulating mobiles, cell towers, wifi or an other radio based transmission media signals (also known as ambient signals) to send signals to another device. To communicate these device either absorb or reflect these radio signals to the other device, this requires no power as the signals already exist. However these device have to communicate slower than normal radio transmission otherwise the signal of the device will be confused with the signals from the ambient signals. Changing to low power transmission media can also improve power usage, changing from bluetooth to bluetooth LE is one such example. Intelligent use of these transmissions can help as well, not transmitting when their is no one there is one example.</p><p>By increasing the amount of power a device can store increases the length between recharging, this is done by increasing power per size of the power supply. Power storage is not developing as quickly as technology as chemist have to find new ways to store energy. Another side of recharging is the time taken to completely recharge traditional chemical batteries are limited by the chemical processes, ultracapacitors charge much faster but don’t store as much power but they may improve in the future </p><p>Easy charging is another aspect of the recharging process. Currently you have to plug your devices in but as the energy transfer rates of induction surfaces and other technologies improve these will properly become more integrated into devices. This will allow the user to simple place their device in a specific place and have it recharge. </p><p>Another solution would be energy harvesting. Energy harvesting can come in several different forms photovoltaic, pesio, thermal and mechanical. Currently photovoltaic is a more robust power supply for these devices, but the other forms like mechanical may become better with time and become a better option or a combination of some of these together. These energy harvesting technologies will either extend the battery life or be able to continuously power the device, this depends on how much draw on power there is compared to the amount being created. </p>

        <p>Why is this important? The internet of things requires for many devices to be running and they all nedd power to run.</p>

        <p>﻿Cars like Google’s driverless car are already driving themselves along with human traffic and making people question the need to issue driver licenses (should a driverless car have to wait in line at the DMV just like their human counterparts? should we allow 4-year-olds to ‘drive’ driverless cars? will my car be considered intoxicated if I fuel it with ethanol? ). Worries aside, this technology will likely be extended towards further automobile automation and IoT integration. Cars may be able to drive their users around, making navigation decisions based on traffic information that they gather from the network of connected cars. Since the cars of the future probably won’t be able to rely on our Earth’s dwindling supply of fossil fuels, they will be recharged at charging ports. Cars will be able to communicate with the power grid and make intelligent decisions about how to charge and when to charge. For instance, power is often cheaper at night because of a lower demand. A car that can tap into a power grid information network could solve the current problem of driving several miles from gas station to gas station, so that you can save a tenth of a cent per gallon. </p><p>Your current car is packed full of safety sensors, gauges, and computer systems (unless you drive a Ford). All these electrical components must be wired with conventional cabling. This cabling adds up to quite a heavy weight - 70 to 80 pounds to be imprecise. Researchers are currently looking at ways to reduce this cabling by making sensors wireless. This would naturally lead to each individual component of a vehicle to be connected to the IoT, giving your car-and the IoT aware world- a clear view into the state of your car. Imagine stepping into your car ten years from now, blissfully lost in a session of World of OculusRiftCraft and mindlessly stepping into your car, vaguely aware that it will get you to work in about 20 minutes. Your car senses that it’s tire pressure is low so it searches the web, looking for the closest service station, drives their on the way to work and has an R2 unit take service your tires before driving you to work. These sorts of things may be possible with an IoT enabled car. </p><p>To make the IoT and automobiles useful, you can’t just have one or two cars connected. One of the major stumbling blocks of the IoT-enabled car (and IoT devices in general) is establishing a common protocol between vehicles. Currently Cisco is leading the way in trying to establish a universal standard, but issues arise when considering the technical complexity and stringent safety requirements of cars. The future probably holds a common Machine-to-machine protocol that will be established so that cars will not only be able to communicate with cars, but any other pertinent device. For instance, there is already a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/transportation/2013/08/traffic_stopping_technologies_waze_smart_traffic_lights_road_trains_and.html">network of cameras installed on streetlights</a> in Toronto. These streetlights communicate over a mobile network, relaying data about traffic congestion. Drivers can access this data with a mobile app and use it to make smart driving choices, reducing their gas consumption. In the IoT future, cars will be able to communicate with a network of traffic sensors, other cars, mobile devices, traffic sensors… virtually every connected and available machine to make smart choices on which tolls to take, which routes are least congested, and probably which drivers are also headed to the same place as you. Hitchhiking might become commonplace. If you prefer to drive in your own car, the IoT could determine which cars are headed towards the same destination as you, forming “trains” of cars which increases efficiency via drafting. </p>
